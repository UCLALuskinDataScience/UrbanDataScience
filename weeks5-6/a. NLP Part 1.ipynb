    "Before we process any text, we need to take a step back and figure out how to get that text into Python. Typically, plans and other policy documents come as PDFs, which are a pain to read. There are dozens of PDF readers for Python, all of which are flawed in different ways. (See some discussions [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-extract-text-from-pdf-245482a96de7), [here](https://johannesfilter.com/python-and-pdf-a-review-of-existing-tools/) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34837707/how-to-extract-text-from-a-pdf-file).)
